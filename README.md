Homework for 4/20 Lesson Seven

Enhance the project Header/Create Footer

Make new issues for each part of work

You must have at least 12 directories (or pages)

Think about where you are going to place the directories(pages) in the navigation menu (using bootstrap)

Create dropdown menus to segment pages, i.e., if you have three bags put them in a dropdown menu called Bags, etc.

Create a footer and put in links to your twelve pages there.

Add some verbage about your links on your footer.

Then you test out your work on your local system

Then you push it to your test repo in github

Then you do a pull request to get from test to main (or master)

Use bootstrap to enhance the styling on your page and give it some design you like.

Thanks Brothers.
