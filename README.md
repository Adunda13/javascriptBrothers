Homework for 3/30

Make three separate directories in Lesson Four folder.

Each directory will contain an index file, a script.js and an (whatever).js file for your object and properties

The idea is to take Lesson Three to an entire new level by trippling what you did by separating into three directories 

Use bootstrap to enhance the styling on your page and give it some design you like.

Thanks Brothers.
