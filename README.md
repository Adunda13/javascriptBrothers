This is a repo for brothers learning JavaScript, platforms and the like.

Homework for 3/23

Make a new script of objects and properties of any item you have at home that has items in it.(just like the travelbag.js)

Then import the new script into the script.js file.

Set up the script to place the item and properties you are using into HTML elements that will show them on the web page.

Then make sure that new script is being called in the index file.

Go to the git repo and make a project, then make an issue for each piece of work you will be doing, such as make an issue to create a new script, an issue to import that script into the script.js file, and an issue to build out the HTML to then pull the items in the new script that will place them on the page.

Make sure to add each issue to the project you created.

Move each issue to the right column (to do, in process or done) as you do your work.

Use bootstrap code to help you.

Check that everything is working on your local page before pushing it to the git repo.

If you are satisfied then do a pull request from test to main.
