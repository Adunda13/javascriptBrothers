Homework for 4/13 Lesson Six

Create a new project on github call it Add to Header/Create Footer

Make issues for each part of work

Add six new directories

Think about where you are going to place the directories(pages) in the navigation menu (using bootstrap)

Create dropdown menus to segment pages, i.e., if you have three bags put them in a dropdown menu called Bags, etc.

Create a footer and put in links to your twelve pages there.

Then you test out your work on your local system

Then you push it to your test repo in github

Then you do a pull request to get from test to main (or master)

Use bootstrap to enhance the styling on your page and give it some design you like.

Thanks Brothers.
