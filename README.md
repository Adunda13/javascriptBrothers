Homework for 4/6 Lesson Five

Create a new project on github call it create a header section

Make issues for each part of work

Create a navigation menu (use bootstrap)

Populate the menu with six directories

Create a home page to link from.

Add something about your six directories onto the home page

create three more directories to add to the three you've already made

Then you test out your work on your local system

Then you push it to your test repo in github

Then you do a pull request to get from test to main (or master)

Use bootstrap to enhance the styling on your page and give it some design you like.

Thanks Brothers.
